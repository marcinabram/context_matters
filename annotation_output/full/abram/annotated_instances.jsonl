What are the possible results and with what probabilities?\n\n<br><br>\n<strong>Generated Answer:</strong>To find the possible results and their probabilities upon measuring, we first need to write the given state in terms of the basis we are measuring with: $|+\\rangle, |-\\rangle$.\n\nBy starting with our 2-qubit state $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle+|11\\rangle)$, we rewrite the states using the identity $|0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+\\rangle + |-\\rangle)$ and $|1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+\\rangle - |-\\rangle)$, which are just conversions into the $|+\\rangle, |- \\rangle$ basis. \n\nAfter applying these identities, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle+|11\\rangle) &= \\frac{1}{2}\\Big( (|+\\rangle + |-\\rangle)\\otimes(|+\\rangle + |-\\rangle) + (|+\\rangle - |-\\rangle)\\otimes(|+\\rangle - |-\\rangle) \\Big) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}(|++\\rangle + |+-\\rangle + |-+\\rangle + |--\\rangle + |++\\rangle - |+-\\rangle - |-+\\rangle + |--\\rangle) \\\\\n&= |++\\rangle + |--\\rangle.\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, in the $|+\\rangle, |-\\rangle$ basis, our 2-qubit state is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|++\\rangle + |--\\rangle)$. \n\nWhen measuring the first qubit:\n\n- If the first qubit is measured as $|+\\rangle$, then the state will collapse to $|+\\rangle \\otimes |+\\rangle = |++\\rangle$ with probability $|\\langle ++|\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|++\\rangle + |--\\rangle)|^2=1/2$.\n\n- If the first qubit is measured as $|-\\rangle$, then the state will collapse to $|-\\rangle \\otimes |-\\rangle = |--\\rangle$ with probability $|\\langle --|\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|++\\rangle + |--\\rangle)|^2=1/2$.\n\nSo, the measurements of the first qubit are equally likely to be $|+\\rangle$ or $|-\\rangle$ (probability of $0.5$ for both). After the measurement, the second qubit will be in the same state as the measured state of the first qubit due to entanglement.\n\n<br><br>\n<strong>Ground Truth:</strong>The state of the two qubits is given by: |\u03a8\u27e9 = \u221a1/2 (|00\u27e9 + |11\u27e9) The first qubit is measured in the basis |+\u27e9, |-\u27e9 where: |+\u27e9 = \u221a1/2 (|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9) |-\u27e9 = \u221a1/2 (|0\u27e9 - |1\u27e9) We can express the state |\u03a8\u27e9 in terms of the new basis: |\u03a8\u27e9 = \u221a1/2 (|00\u27e9 + |11\u27e9) = \u221a1/8((|+\u27e9 + |-\u27e9) \u2297 (|+\u27e9 + |-\u27e9) + (|+\u27e9 - |-\u27e9) \u2297 (|+\u27e9 - |-\u27e9)). The calculation gives |\u03a8\u27e9 = \u221a1/2 (|++\u27e9 + |--\u27e9). Now, the probability of measuring |+\u27e9 for the first qubit is given by the squared magnitude of the coefficient of |+\u27e9 in the state |\u03a8\u27e9, which is (1/\u221a2)^2 = 1/2. Similarly, the probability of measuring |-\u27e9 for the first qubit is also (1/\u221a2)^2 = 1/2.
