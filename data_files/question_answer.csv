1000,Mechanics_01,Question – Answer 1,How good is the answer?,"Question 1: What is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and how does it apply to the position and momentum of a particle?

<br><br>
<strong>Generated Answer:</strong> The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that you can't simultaneously know the exact position and exact speed of an object. For a particle, it means the more precisely we know its position, the less precisely we know its momentum, and vice versa.

<br><br>
<strong>Ground Truth:</strong> The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, represented as <p>\[\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}\]</p>, expresses a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, such as position x and momentum p, can be known simultaneously. For a particle, it implies that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum cannot be smaller than a certain value, specifically <p>\[\frac{\hbar}{2}\]</p> where \[\hbar \] is the reduced Planck constant.

1001,Mechanics_02,Question – Answer 2,How good is the answer?,"Question 2: Explain the concept of quantum tunneling.

<br><br>
<strong>Generated Answer:</strong> Quantum tunneling is like a particle magically appearing on the other side of a barrier it normally couldn't pass through, like a wall.

<br><br>
<strong>Ground Truth:</strong> Quantum tunneling is a quantum mechanical phenomenon where a particle has a probability of passing through a potential barrier, even if its energy is lower than the height of the barrier. This can be described by the wave function of the particle, which does not vanish at the barrier, allowing a non-zero probability of finding the particle on the other side. Mathematically, if the barrier is represented by a potential V and the energy of the particle is E, the tunneling probability depends on the overlap of the wave functions on either side of the barrier.

1002,Mechanics_03,Question – Answer 3,How good is the answer?,"Question 3: Describe the concept of superposition in quantum mechanics.

<br><br>
<strong>Generated Answer:</strong> Superposition in quantum mechanics means an object can be in multiple states at the same time, like a coin spinning in the air being both heads and tails.

<br><br>
<strong>Ground Truth:</strong> Superposition in quantum mechanics refers to the property of a quantum system to exist in multiple states simultaneously. This is represented mathematically by the state vector of the system, which is a linear combination of the basis states. For example, if a particle can be in state |A> and state |B>, then it can also be in any state  <p>\[ |\psi> = \alpha|A> + \beta|B> \]</p>, where \[\alpha \] and \[\beta \] are complex numbers, and <p>\[ |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1 \]</p>.
